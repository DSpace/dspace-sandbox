DSpace SWORD Implementation Documentation
=========================================

Required Configuration
----------------------

# tell the SWORD METS implementation which package ingester to use
# to install deposited content.  This should refer to one of the
# classes configured for:
#
# plugin.named.org.dspace.content.packager.PackageIngester
#
# The value of sword.mets-ingester.package-ingester tells the 
# system which named plugin for this interface should be used 
# to ingest SWORD METS packages
#
# The default is METS
#
# sword.mets-ingester.package-ingester = METS

# Define the metadata type EPDCX (EPrints DC XML)
# to be handled by the SWORD crosswalk configuration
#
mets.submission.crosswalk.EPDCX = SWORD

# define the stylesheet which will be used by the self-named
# XSLTIngestionCrosswalk class when asked to load the SWORD
# configuration (as specified above).  This will use the
# specified stylesheet to crosswalk the incoming SWAP metadata
# to the DIM format for ingestion
#
crosswalk.submission.SWORD.stylesheet = crosswalks/sword-swap-ingest.xsl

# The base URL of the SWORD deposit.  This is the URL from
# which DSpace will construct the deposit location urls for
# collections.
#
# The default is {dspace.url}/dspace-sword/deposit
#
# In the event that you are not deploying DSpace as the ROOT
# application in the servlet container, this will generate
# incorrect URLs, and you should override the functionality
# by specifying in full as below:
#
# sword.deposit.url = http://www.myu.ac.uk/dspace-sword/deposit

# The metadata field in which to store the updated date for 
# items deposited via SWORD.
#
sword.updated.field = dc.date.updated

Installation
------------

- Ensure that you have included the configuration required

- Import the metadata registry entries required using the file
  config/registries/sword-metadata.xml
  
- Copy the default ingest crosswalk from the file
  config/crosswalks/sword-swap-ingest.xsl
  into the dspace directory config/crosswalks
  
Testing
-------

Supplied along with the source code is a package which can
be used for testing.  This consists of a manifest.xml file,
which is a METS document containing a Dublin Core XML section
of descriptive metadata which conforms to the SWAP standard.
Thera are additionally 3 example PDF files and a single plain
text file licence.txt which contains an example deposit licence.

These files are provided additionally inside a zip file which
should form the content of a deposit request.

These files are all available in the directory: test

Implementation Notes
--------------------

- DSpace has no equivalent for the sword term "treatment".  This
  is therefore always null in Service Document requests
  
- The logic of onBehalfOf is as follows:  The list of collections
  which is supplied during a request which is done onBehalfOf
  another user is the intersection of the lists of collections
  that the authenticated user can submit to and the list that the
  onBehalfOf user can submit to.

- This implementation only supports the default PasswordAuthentication
  mechanism for DSpace.  Modifications are required to tie it in to
  alternative authentication mechanisms.
