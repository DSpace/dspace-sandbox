=========================================

Required Configuration
----------------------

# tell the SWORD METS implementation which package ingester to use
# to install deposited content.  This should refer to one of the
# classes configured for:
#
# plugin.named.org.dspace.content.packager.PackageIngester
#
# The value of sword.mets-ingester.package-ingester tells the 
# system which named plugin for this interface should be used 
# to ingest SWORD METS packages
#
# The default is METS
#
# sword.mets-ingester.package-ingester = METS

# Define the metadata type SWAP (Scholarly Works Application Profile)
# to be handled by the SWORD crosswalk configuration
#
mets.submission.crosswalk.SWAP = SWORD

# define the stylesheet which will be used by the self-named
# XSLTIngestionCrosswalk class when asked to load the SWORD
# configuration (as specified above).  This will use the
# specified stylesheet to crosswalk the incoming SWAP metadata
# to the DIM format for ingestion
#
crosswalk.submission.SWORD.stylesheet = crosswalks/sword-swap.xsl

# The base URL of the SWORD deposit.  This is the URL from
# which DSpace will construct the deposit location urls for
# collections.
#
# The default is {dspace.url}/dspace-sword/deposit
#
# sword.deposit.url = http://www.myu.ac.uk/dspace-sword/deposit
