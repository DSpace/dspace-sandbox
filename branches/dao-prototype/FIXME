Stuff that needs fixin':
 * think about where to cache objects in the Context. currently happens in
   constructors, but should maybe happen elsewhere (should objects be
   responsible for cacheing themselves? probably not).
 * CommunityDAOTest sometimes hangs for no apparent reason during test runs.
   Could be a db connection thing, but it should be investigated.
